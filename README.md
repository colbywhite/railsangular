A simple skeleton app that consists of Rails and Angular.

It is intended to be an example on how to quickly get a rails app up with the stuff in it. It can be used as a 
starting point for anybody else. 

It is largely taken from [David Bryant Copeland's](http://naildrivin5.com/) [book on the subject](http://angular-rails.com), particularly the 
[bootstrap chapter](http://angular-rails.com/bootstrap.html). But there are minor tweaks. @davetron5000++

It was made with `Rails 4.2.3` and `ruby 2.2.0`
